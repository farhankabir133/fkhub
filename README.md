## 🚀 How to Deploy this Website (Step by Step)

Below is a guide on how the website is deployed to GitHub Pages from scratch, so others can replicate it too:

---

### 1️⃣ **Prepare the Project**

* Build your static website files: `index.html`, `style.css`, and optionally any JS or image assets.
* Test it locally by opening `index.html` in a browser to make sure it works.

### 2️⃣ **Create a GitHub Repository**

* Log in to [GitHub](https://github.com).
* Click on **New repository**.
* Name the repository: for example `fkhub`.
* Make it **Public**.
* (Optional) Initialize with a `README.md`.
* Click **Create repository**.

### 3️⃣ **Push Your Code**

If you haven’t already cloned the repository, open your terminal and run:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/your-username/fkhub.git
cd fkhub
```

Copy your website files (`index.html`, `style.css`, etc.) into this folder.

Then add, commit, and push your code:

```bash
git add .
git commit -m "Initial commit with website files"
git push origin main
```

---

### 4️⃣ **Enable GitHub Pages**

* Go to your repository on GitHub.
* Click on **Settings**.
* On the left menu, click **Pages**.
* Under **Source**, choose the branch `main` (or `master`) and the folder `/root`.
* Click **Save**.
* After a few seconds, GitHub will generate your site URL:
  Example: `https://your-username.github.io/fkhub/`

### 6️⃣ **(Optional) Update the Site**
